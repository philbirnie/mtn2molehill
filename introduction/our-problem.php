	<h1>Our Problem</h1>

	<p>The responsive <em>design process</em> results in the design being heavier than a non-responsive or mobile-separate site would be.</p>

	<h3>Why are Responsively Designed Sites Inherently Heavier?</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>We resort to <code>display:none</code> in our media queries to hide things we don't need</li>
		<li>Almost never using optimally sized images for the screen size</li>
		<li>We load extra scripts, stylesheets, and elements that we may not need.</li>
	</ul>
