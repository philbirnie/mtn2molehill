	<h1>A Prelude</h1>

	<p>Many of these techniques are not new - but with a RWD, it is imperative that we execute these techniques because failing to optimize our sites is often much more apparent on mobile devices.</p>

	<h2>Goals</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Reduce the NUMBER of requests, thereby reducing latency</li>
		<li>Reduce the SIZE of requests, thereby reducing load times on slow connection speeds</li>
		<li>Prioritize the loading of our assets and events so that our sites appear to be faster.</li>
	</ul>
