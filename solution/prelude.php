	<h1>A Prelude</h1>

	<p>Many of these techniques are not new - but with a RWD, it is imperative that we execute these techniques because failing to optimize our sites is often much more apparent on mobile devices.</p>

	<h2>Goals</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Reduce the <strong>NUMBER</strong> of requests, thereby reducing latency</li>
		<li>Reduce the <strong>SIZE</strong> of requests, thereby reducing transfer times</li>
		<li>Prioritize the loading of our assets and events so that our sites appear to be faster.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Disclaimer</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>We&#8217;re entering Alice&#8217;s rabbit hole</li>
		<li>Mobile optimization is kind of like golf</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Let's look at each of our goals in greater detail&#8230;</p>
